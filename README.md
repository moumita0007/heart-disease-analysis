# Heart Disease Analysis using SQL & Python

This project analyzes clinical data to uncover key risk factors associated with heart disease. Using SQL for subgroup analysis and Python for visualization, it identifies trends based on age, gender, chest pain type, cholesterol, and more.

## 🔍 Objectives

- Perform subgroup analysis on patient health records  
- Visualize trends to understand disease patterns  
- Derive actionable insights for early detection and prevention

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **SQL** – For querying and subgroup analysis  
- **Python** – For data cleaning and visualization  
  - `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

## 📌 Key Insights

- Middle-aged individuals (40–60) are more affected
- Males have higher disease prevalence than females
- Asymptomatic chest pain (Type 3) is highly associated with heart disease
- Lower max heart rate is common in heart disease patients
- Fasting blood sugar is not a strong standalone predictor

## 📁 Files Included

- `cleaned_heart_data.csv` – Preprocessed dataset  
- `analysis.ipynb` – Python notebook with visualizations  
- `sql_queries.sql` – Subgroup analysis queries  
- `presentation.pptx` – Project summary slides (optional)

## ✅ Conclusion

The analysis helps identify important health patterns that can aid in better screening and preventive care. Combining multiple features improves accuracy in detecting heart disease risk.
